## Inspiration
Personal Difficulties in Recycling

## What it does
Helps user determine if a product is recyclable or not

## How we built it
React-Native

## Challenges we ran into
React-Native Dependency Tree kept breaking :expressionless:

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finishing and building the app despite time constraints And of course, the app itself!

## What we learned
Recycling is a lot more nuanced and difficult than it should be

## aWhat's next for Recycling App
Contact businesses for their help in compiling information
Multiple Location Support
Allow users to submit request for non-tracked products
Gamify the app by adding statistics of the impact of userâ€™s recycling habits
